# Changes in Ice 3.7.2

These are the changes since Ice 3.7.1.

## General Changes

- Add support for TLS 1.3 to IceSSL.

- Add support for reading Ice properties from the HKCU Windows registry hive. Previously
  you could only read properties from the HKLM Windows registry hive.

## C++ Changes

- Fixed a bug where the callback set with the `IceUtil::CtrlCHandler` was not
  cleared on destruction of the `CtrlCHandler` object. Variables captured by the
  callback were therefore not released until static destruction. This fix
  ensures that the destruction of the `CtrlCHandler` object clears the
  callback.

- Fixed a debug assert in the Windows SChannel IceSSL implementation which would
  occur in rare circumstances where SChannel returned `SEC_E_INCOMPLETE_MESSAGE`
  with a `cbBuffer` value of 0. This occurred when running the JavaScript tests
  with Firefox and using a C++ debug build.

- Fixed a bug in the syslog logger that caused the program name to not be correctly
  displayed with log messages.

- Fixed an IceStorm bug that prevented topics from being restored from the database
  when there was multiple topics.

- Added support for systemd `Type=Notify` to `Ice::Service`. Services
  started without the `--daemon` command-line option send notifications
  to systemd using the `sd_notify` API.

- Added systemd journal logger. This logger is enabled by setting the
  `Ice.UseSystemdJournal` property to a value of 1 or greater.

- Fixed memory leak in the Ice iAP transport where the `EASession` object wasn't
  correctly released. Thanks to @astreube on GitHub for reporting this bug and
  suggesting a fix.

- Fixed a bug in the Windows build system that disabled wildcard expansion for
  Slice compiler command line arguments.

- Fixed a bug in the code that parses command line options that caused short command
  line options to be incorrectly parsed when multiple short command line options
  are specified together.

- Fixed a bug in IceGrid that could result in an infinite loop when `Ice.ChangeUser` is
  set and the call to `getpwnam_r` fails with `ERANGE`.

- Fixed SChannel initialization to use a global mutex to avoid crashes occurring with
  latest SChannel updates. See: https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/issues/242

- Add support to build Ice in C++17 mode.

- Add support for ARM builds with RHELP and CentOS.

- Allow users to configure the adapter created by `icegridadmin` when run in server mode.
  Thanks to Michael Dorner for the pull request: https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/pull/58

## C# Changes

- Fixed metrics bug where remote invocations for `flushBatchRequests` weren't
  counted.

- Add ability to build .NET Core assemblies with strong name.

- Add Android, iOS and UWP platform support to Ice for .NET Core. The Ice test
  suite now works with Xamarin and runs on Android, iOS and UWP.

- Fixed marshaling code: removed unsafe code used in ByteBuffer that was
  causing problems with mono on Android.

- Fixed a bug in `slice2cs` that could result in generated code using
  invalid namespace qualification for a type.
  See: https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/issues/122

- Removed dependency on the Ice Builder Visual Studio Extension for C# source builds.

- You can now map Slice modules to custom C# namespaces using the `cs:namespace`
  metadata directive.

## Java Changes

- Fixed Android IceSSL issue that caused SSL connections to hang
  with Android >= 8.0.

- Fixed metrics bug where remote invocations for `flushBatchRequests` weren't
  counted.

- Improved Javadoc support for the Java mapping (and not Java-Compat). Internal
  classes and methods with public or protected visibility are now excluded or
  tagged `@hidden`. Since `@hidden` requires javadoc 9 or greater, javadoc is no
  longer generated with javadoc 8.
  The new Gradle target `alljavadoc` generates a complete API reference for all
  Ice components (Ice, IceSSL, IceGrid, IceStorm, Glacier2, etc.).

- IceGrid GUI settings are now stored in the operating system application data
  directory `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ZeroC` for Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/ZeroC`
  for macOS and `~/.ZeroC` for Linux. Previous settings are automatically migrated to the
  new location without user intervention.

- Add support to build IceGrid GUI with OpenJFX and Java 11 JDK.

- Fixed a bug in the IceGrid GUI that could cause IceGrid GUI to hang after a login
  failure.

## JavaScript Changes

- Add TypeScript declaration files for Ice for JavaScript.

- The Slice to JavaScript compiler can now generate TypeScript declaration files
  for JavaScript generated code using the `--typescript` command line option.

- Fixed generated code for sequences of interface by value types. The generated
  sequence helper must use `Ice.Value` as the element type for the sequence
  and not a class with the name of the interface when the element type is an
  interface by value.

- Add missing `OutputStream.writeException` method.

- Update JavaScript build system to Babel 7 and gulp 4.0. Support for building
  Ice for JavaScript with NodeJS 4 and NodeJS 5 has been removed.

- Fixed a bug in Slice-to-JavaScript compiler that resulted in incorrect generated
  code for classes containing a data member of type `Value`. Thanks to Daniel Lytkin
  for the bug report and fix. See https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/pull/203

## MATLAB Changes

- Fixed a bug that caused the code generated by `slice2matlab` to throw a type
  conversion exception. This affected classes or structs containing a dictionary
  mapped to a structure array.

- Add support for `IceSSL::ConnectionInfo`.

## Objective-C Changes

- Fixed a bug in Slice-to-Objective-C compiler that resulted in incorrect generated
  code for classes containing a data member of type `Value`.

## PHP Changes

- Fixed build failure when building with the Debug configuration on Windows.

- Fixed a bug that caused the generated code to reference undefined variables
  when included (using `require` or `require_once`) from a static method.

## Python Changes

- Add support for unmarshaling sequences of basic types using the [buffer
  protocol][1]. This can be enabled using the metadata `python:array.array`,
  `python:numpy.ndarray` or `python:memoryview:<factory>`. The first two enable
  mapping to the `array.array` and `numpy.ndarray` types respectively and the
  last one allows to specify a custom Python factory function responsible for
  creating the sequence from a `memoryview` object.

- Add `python:default`, `python:list` and `python:tuple` metadata which are
  equivalent to `python:seq:default`, `python:seq:list` and `python:seq:tuple`
  respectively.

- Fixed Python segfault that could occur because of a KeyboardInterrupt.

- Add support to build Ice for Python using Python 3.7.

# Changes in Ice 3.7.1

These are the changes since Ice 3.7.0.

## General Changes

- Fixed UDP multicast issue where adding multicast membership on all the
  available network interfaces on the host would fail with an "Address already
  in use" error if the host had network interfaces with multiple IPv4 addresses
  or different interfaces using the same IP address.

- Improved `Ice::ObjectAdapter` `getPublishedEndpoints` and
  `refreshPublishedEndpoints` methods to now return or refresh the Ice router
  server endpoints if the adapter is associated with a router. Calling the
  `setPublishedEndpoints` method on an adapter associated with a router also now
  raises an invalid argument exception.

- Added tracing support for IceGrid and locator discovery. The IceGrid registry
  supports the `IceGrid.Registry.Trace.Discovery` property and the
  `IceLocatorDiscovery` plug-in supports `IceLocatorDiscovery.Trace.Lookup` to
  trace lookup requests.

- Instead of succeeding, `Ice::Connection::setAdapter` now raises
  `Ice.ObjectAdapterDeactivatedException` if the adapter is deactivated.

- Fixed bug where the `IceGrid.Registry.Client.ACM.Timeout` property setting
  was ignored.

- Added the ice_fixed proxy method to create a fixed proxy bound to a given
  connection.

- Added the ice_getTimeout and ice_getCompress proxy methods. These methods
  return an optional value that contains the proxy timeout or compression
  override setting. If the timeout or the compression setting haven't been
  overridden with ice_timeout or ice_compress, the optional value is unset.

- Fixed IceGrid node bug where a replica would not get up-to-date object
  adapter information about a server if an update was pending for the
  server. Thanks to Michael Gmelin for the bug report and fix.

- Fixed IceGrid registry to no longer allow dynamic registration of a replica
  group if this replica group is already registered with the deployment
  facility. Registration was previously allowed but the dynamically registered
  adapter members of the replica group were never used.

- IceBridge can now be configured as a router in a client's object adapter,
  which means the Ice run time in the client will automatically set up a
  bidirectional connection.

## C++ Changes

- Fixed a Windows bug with the WS transport where at-most-once semantics weren't
  always enforced causing invalid invocation retries on failures.

- Added the "cpp:noexcept" metadata to operations in several local Slice
  interfaces, including Communicator, Connection, and ObjectAdapter.
  This helps to clarify that these operations do not raise exceptions.

- Slice documentation comments are now preserved in the generated C++ code
  using Doxygen markup.

## C# Changes

- Disabled Windows fast path loopback socket option. This option was
  already disabled with the C++ mapping. It's causing hangs at the
  TCP/IP level when connections are closed.

- Added support for .NET Core 2.0 on Windows and Linux.

- Added the ice_initialize partial method to generated structs and classes.
  This method is called by constructors after initialization of the data
  members. By implementing this method users can customize struct and
  class initialization.

## Java Changes

- The java:package metadata can now be applied to modules. It can still
  be used as global metadata, in which case it serves as the default
  directive unless overridden by module metadata.

## JavaScript Changes

- Updated the generated code for compatibility with WebPack.

## MATLAB Changes

- Added a MATLAB language mapping. It provides a client-side run time and
  supports MATLAB versions R2016a through R2018a on Windows.

## Objective-C Changes

- Fixed the generated code to specify the `__autoreleasing` qualifier on
  parameters returned by reference. Xcode 9.0 now emits a warning if this
  qualifier is omitted.

## PHP Changes

- Fixed Ice for PHP build failure when building with PHP5 ZTS.

## Python Changes

- The python:package metadata can now be applied to modules. It can still
  be used as global metadata, in which case it serves as the default
  directive unless overridden by module metadata.

- Fixed a bug that caused Python to crash on exit when the extension is
  built with GCC 7.

## Ruby Changes

- Ice::initialize now accepts an implicit block. If provided, initialize
  will pass the communicator (and optionally the argument vector) to the
  block, destroy the communicator upon the block's completion, and return
  the block's result as the result of initialize.

# Changes in Ice 3.7.0

These are the changes since the Ice 3.6 release or snapshot described in
[CHANGELOG-3.6.md](./CHANGELOG-3.6.md).

## General Changes

- Added `ice_getSlicedData` method to the `Value` and `UserException` base
  classes. This method can be used to obtain the sliced data when available.

- Fixed IceGrid inconsistency when resolving dynamically registered replica
  group endpoints. Like for replica group registered with descriptors, if the
  replica group members don't support the encoding requested by the client, the
  client will raise `Ice::NoEndpointException` instead of
  `Ice::NotRegisteredException`.

- Defining operations on non-local classes is now deprecated: operations should
  be defined only on interfaces and local classes. Likewise, having a class
  implement an interface, passing a class by proxy and passing an interface by
  value are now deprecated.

- Added new Slice keyword `Value`. All Slice classes implicitly derive from the
  `Value` class, and a parameter of type `Value` can represent any class
  instance. In prior release, the base class for Slice classes was `Object`,
  and for non-local definitions, `Object` remains a synonym for `Value`.
  (However, `Value*` is invalid: it cannot be used as a synonym for `Object*`).
  For local definitions, `Object` designates a servant while `Value`
  designates a class instance.

- Semicolons are now optional after braces in Slice definitions. For example
  ```
  module M
  {
      enum { A, B, C , D }

      interface Intf
      {
          void op();
      }
  }
  ```
  is equivalent to
  ```
  module M
  {
      enum { A, B, C , D };

      interface Intf
      {
          void op();
      };
  };
  ```

- The server run time will now bind to all the addresses associated with a DNS
  name specified in an endpoint of the object adapter (with the endpoint -h
  option). You must make sure the DNS name resolves to local addresses only.

  If no `PublishedEndpoints` property is specified for the object adapter, the
  published endpoints for an endpoint with a DNS name will either be, if the
  endpoint doesn't specifies a fixed port, a list of endpoints with each of
  the addresses associated with the DNS name or, if it specifies a fixed port,
  the endpoint with the DNS name.

- Added the IceBridge service, which acts as a bridge between a client and
  server to relay requests and replies in both directions.

- Added new operation metadata, `marshaled-result`, in C++11, C#, Java,
  and Python. When this metadata is specified, the generated code for the
  servant dispatch returns a generated struct that contains the marshaled
  values for the return and out parameters.

- A Slice enumeration (enum) now creates a new namespace scope for its
  enumerators. In previous releases, the enumerators were in the same
  namespace scope as the enumeration. For example:
  ```
     enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Pear }
     enum ComputerBrands { Apple, Dell, HP } // Ok as of Ice 3.7, error in
                                              // prior releases
  ```
  The mapping of enum to C++, C#, Java etc. is not affected by this
  change. Slice constants and data member default values that reference
  enumerators should be updated to use only the enumerator's name when the
  enclosing enum is in a different module. For example:
  ```
  module M1
  {
      enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Pear }
      enum ComputerBrands { Apple, Dell, HP }

      const Fruit a = Apple; // Recommended syntax for all Ice releases
  }

  module M2
  {
      const M1::Fruit a1 = Apple;             // The recommended syntax as of
                                              // Ice 3.7
      const M1::Fruit a2 = M1::Fruit::Apple;  // Ok as well
      const M1::Fruit a3 = M1::Apple;         // Supported for backwards
                                              // compatibility with earlier
                                              // Ice releases
  }

  ```

- Added Bluetooth transport plug-in for C++ and Android. The C++ plug-in
  requires BlueZ 5.40 or later.

- Added support for iAP transport to allow iOS clients to communicate with
  connected accessories.

- Added new overloads to `Ice::initialize` in C++11, C++98, C#, Java,
  Java Compat, Python and Ruby. They accept a `configFile` string parameter as
  an alternative to the `InitializationData` parameter of several existing
  `Ice::initialize` overloads.

- Added support for a new `Ice.ClassGraphDepthMax` property to prevent stack
  overflows in case a sender sends a very large graph.

  The unmarshaling or destruction of a graph of Slice class instances is a
  recursive operation. This property limits the amount of stack size required to
  perform these operations. This property is supported with all the language
  mappings except Java and JavaScript where it's not needed (the run time
  environment allows graceful handling of stack overflows).

  The default maximum class graph depth is 100. If you increase this value, you
  must ensure the thread pool stack size is large enough to allow reading graphs
  without causing a stack overflow.

- Minor change to the network and retry tracing. Connection establishment
  attempts on endpoints are no longer traced with Ice.Trace.Retry. They are
  now traced when Ice.Trace.Network is set to 2.

- Renamed ACM heartbeat enumerator `HeartbeatOnInvocation` to
  `HeartbeatOnDispatch`.

- Added `Ice::ObjectAdapter::setPublishedEndpoints` to allow updating the
  published endpoints programmatically.

- Added new `ice_id` method or member function to all Ice exceptions; `ice_id`
  returns the Slice type ID of the exception. It replaces the now deprecated
  `ice_name` method or member function.

- Added `Ice::Connection::throwException`. When the connection is closed, this
  method throws an exception indicating the reason of the connection closure.

- Changed the Slice definition of the `Connection::close` operation to take an
  enumerator instead of a boolean. The new enumeration, `ConnectionClose`,
  defines three enumerators for controlling how the connection is closed:

  - `Forcefully` - Closes the connection immediately. Equivalent to the boolean
  value true in previous releases.

  - `Gracefully` - Closes the connection gracefully without waiting for pending
  invocations to complete.

  - `GracefullyWithWait` - Closes the connection gracefully after all pending
  invocations have completed. Equivalent to the boolean value false in previous
  releases.

  The `Ice::ForcedCloseConnectionException` exception has also been replaced
  with `Ice::ConnectionManuallyClosedException`. This exception is set on the
  connection when `Connection::close` is called.

- Added support for IceStorm subscriber `locatorCacheTimeout` and
  `connectionCached` QoS settings. These settings match the proxy settings and
  allow configuring per-request load balancing on the subscriber proxy.

- Implementations of the `Ice::Router` interface can now indicate whether or not
  they support a routing table through the optional out parameter
  `hasRoutingTable` of the `getClientProxy` operation. The Ice run time won't
  call the `addProxies` operation if the router implementation indicates that it
  doesn't manage a routing table.

- The `findObjectByType`, `findAllObjectsByType`,
  `findObjectByTypeOnLeastLoadedNode` operations from the `IceGrid::Query`
  interface and the `allocateObjectByType` operation from the `IceGrid::Session`
  interfaces now only return proxies for Ice objects from enabled servers. If a
  server is disabled, its well-known or allocatable Ice objects won't be
  returned anymore to clients.

- The Communicator and Connection `flushBatchRequests` operations now require
  an argument to specify whether or not the batch requests to flush should be
  compressed. See the documentation of the `Ice::CompressBatch` enumeration
  for the different options available to specify when the batch should be
  compressed.

- The UDP server endpoint now supports specifying `--interface *` to join the
  multicast group using all the local interfaces. It's also now the default
  behavior if no `--interface` option is specified.

- Ice no longer halts a program if it can't accept new incoming connections when
  the system runs out of file descriptors. Instead, it rejects queued pending
  connections and temporarily stops accepting new connections. An error message
  is also sent to the Ice logger.

- Dispatch interceptors and `ice_dispatch` can now catch user exceptions. User
  exceptions raised by a servant dispatch are propagated to `ice_dispatch` and
  may be raised by the implementation of `Ice::DispatchInterceptor::dispatch`.
  As a result, the `Ice::DispatchStatus` enumeration has been removed. See the
  Ice Manual for details on the new dispatch interceptor API.

- The `ice_getConnection` operation now correctly returns a connection if
  connection caching is disabled (it previously returned a null connection).

- The iOS SSL transport is now based on the same implementation as macOS. Most
  of the functionality supported on macOS is now also supported on iOS. There
  are still few limitations however:

  - the `checkValidity`, `getNotBefore`, `getNotAfter` methods are not supported
    on the `IceSSL::Certificate` class.

  - only PKCS12 certificates are supported (no support for PEM).

- The `Ice::ConnectionInfo` `sndSize` and `rcvSize` data members have been moved
  to the TCP and UDP connection info classes. The `Ice::WSEndpointInfo` and
  `IceSSL::EndpointInfo` classes no longer inherit `Ice::IPConnectionInfo` and
  instead directly extend `Ice::ConnectionInfo`. IP connection information can
  still be retrieved by accessing the connection information object stored with
  the new `underlying` data member.

- IceGrid and IceStorm now use LMDB for their persistent storage instead of
  Freeze/Berkeley DB.

- Added support for two additional IceGrid variables: `server.data` and
  `service.data`. These variables point to server and service specific data
  directories created by IceGrid on the node. These data directories are
  automatically removed by IceGrid if you remove the server from the
  deployment.

  For consistency, the `node.datadir` variable has been deprecated, use the
  `node.data` variable instead.

- Added the new metadata tag `delegate` for local interfaces with one operation.
  Interfaces with this metadata will be generated as a `std::function` in C++11,
  `delegate` in C#, `FunctionalInterface` in Java, `function callback` in
  JavaScript, `block` in Objective-C, `function/lambda` in Python. Other language
  mappings keep their default behavior.

- `ObjectFactory` has been deprecated in favor of the new local interface
  `ValueFactory`. Communicator operations `addObjectFactory`and
  `findObjectFactory` have been deprecated in favor of similar operations on the
  new interface `ValueFactoryManager`.

- Replaced `Ice::NoObjectFactoryException` with `Ice::NoValueFactoryException`.

- The Slice compiler options `--ice` and `--underscore` are now deprecated, and
  replaced by the global Slice metadata `ice-prefix` and `underscore`.

- Renamed local interface metadata `async` to `async-oneway`.

- Replaced `ConnectionCallback` by delegates `CloseCallback` and
 `HeartbeatCallback`.  Also replaced `setCallback` by `setCloseCallback` and
  `setHeartbeatCallback` on the `Connection` interface.

- Updating Windows build system to use MSBuild instead of nmake.

- Changed the parsing of hex escape sequences (\x....) in Slice string literals:
  the parsing now stops after 2 hex digits. For example, `\x0ab` is now read as
  `\x0a` followed by `b`. Previously all the hex digits were read like in C++.

- Stringified identities and proxies now support non-ASCII characters
  and universal character names (`\unnnn` and `\Unnnnnnnn`). See the property
  `Ice.ToStringMode` and the static function/method `identityToString`.

- Fixed proxies stringification: `Communicator::proxyToString` and equivalent
  "to string" methods on fixed proxies no longer raise a `FixedProxyException`;
  the proxy is just stringified without endpoints.

- An empty endpoint in an Object Adapter endpoint list is now rejected with an
  `EndpointParseException`; such an endpoint was ignored in previous releases.

- IcePatch2 and IceGrid's distribution mechanism (based on IcePatch2) are now
  deprecated.

- Updated IceSSL hostname verification (enabled with `IceSSL.CheckCertName`) to
  use the native checks of the platform's SSL implementation.

- Removed `IceSSL::NativeConnectionInfo`. `IceSSL::ConnectionInfo`'s `certs` data
  member is now mapped to the native certificate type in C++, Java and C#. In
  other languages, it remains mapped to a string sequence containing the PEM
  encoded certificates.

- Freeze has been moved to its own source repository,
  https://github.com/zeroc-ice/freeze.

- Added support for suppressing Slice warnings using the `[["suppress-warning"]]`
  global metadata directive. If one or more categories are specified (for
  example `"suppress-warning:invalid-metadata"` or
  `"suppress-warning:deprecated, invalid-metadata"`) only warnings matching these
  categories are suppressed, otherwise all warnings are suppressed.

## C++ Changes

- Added `Ice::SlicedData::clear` method to allow clearing the slices associated
  with the slice data. Calling `clear` can be useful if the sliced data contains
  cycles. You should call this method if your application receives sliced values
  which might contain cycles.

- Added a new C++11 mapping that takes advantage of C++11 language features. This
  new mapping is very different from the Slice-to-C++ mapping provided in prior
  releases. The old mapping, now known as the C++98 mapping, is still supported
  so that existing applications can be migrated to Ice 3.7 without much change.

- Added support for Visual Studio 2010 (C++98 only)

- The `Ice::Communicator` and `Ice::ObjectAdapter` `destroy` functions are now
  declared as `noexcept` (C++11) or `throw()` (C++98).

- Added new helper class `Ice::CommunicatorHolder`. `CommunicatorHolder`
  creates a `Communicator` in its constructor and destroys it in its destructor.

- The `--dll-export` option of `slice2cpp` is now deprecated, and replaced by
  the global Slice metadata `cpp:dll-export:SYMBOL`.

- The UDP and WS transports are no longer enabled by default with static builds
  of the Ice library. You need to register them explicitly with the
  `Ice::registerIceUDP` or `Ice::registerIceWS` function to use these transports
   with your statically linked application.

  NOTE: this affects UWP and iOS applications which are linked statically with
  Ice libraries.

- Added `cpp:scoped` metadata for enums in the C++98 mapping. The generated C++
  enumerators for a "scoped enum" are prefixed with the enumeration's name. For
  example:
  ```
     // Slice
     ["cpp:scoped"] enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Pear }
  ```
  corresponds to:
  ```
     // C++98
     enum Fruit { FruitApple, FruitOrange, FruitPear };
  ```

- Upgrade the UWP IceSSL implementation to support client side certificates and
  custom certificate verification.

- Added `getOpenSSLVersion` function to `IceSSL::OpenSSL::Plugin` to retrieve
  the OpenSSL version used by the Ice run time.

- Added `getAuthorityKeyIdentifier` and `getSubjectKeyIdentifier` functions to
  `IceSSL::Certificate`. These functions are not supported on iOS or UWP.

- Improved the IceSSL Certificate API to allow retrieving X509v3 extensions.
  This feature is currently only available with OpenSSL and SChannel.

- Refactored the IceSSL Plug-in API to allow loading multiple implementations of
  the plug-in in the same process. Each communicator can load a single
  implementation, but separate communicators in the same process can load
  different implementations.

- Added ability to build IceSSL with OpenSSL on Windows. The resulting library
  is named `icesslopenssl`. An application can load this plug-in with the
  `IceSSLOpenSSL:createIceSSLOpenSSL` entry point.

- Added `IceSSL.SchannelStrongCrypto` property: when set to a value greater than
  0, the IceSSL SChannel implementation sets the `SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO` flag,
  which instructs SChannel to disable weak cryptographic algorithms. The default
  values for this property is 0 for increased interoperability.

- Improve Linux stack traces generated by `Exception::ice_stackTrace`, by using
  libbacktrace when available.

- Fixed IceGrid PlatformInfo to report the correct release and version number
  for recent versions of Windows.

- IceSSL has been updated to support OpenSSL 1.1.0 version.

## C# Changes

- Added a new C# AMI mapping based on TAP (Task-based Asynchronous Pattern).
  With this mapping, you can use the C# async/away keywords with
  asynchronous invocations and dispatches (AMI and AMD).

- Updated the AMD mapping to be Task-based. Chaining AMD and AMI calls is now
  straightforward.

- Added the proxy method `ice_scheduler`. It returns an instance of
  `System.Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler` that you can pass to `Task` methods
  such as `ContinueWith` in order to force a continuation to be executed by
  an Ice thread pool thread.

- The `batchRequestInterceptor` data member of `Ice.InitializationData` is now
  defined as a `System.Action<Ice.BatchRequest, int, int>` delegate. You will
  need to update your code accordingly if you were using the now removed
  `Ice.BatchRequestInterceptor` interface.

- The `Ice.PropertiesUpdateCallback` interface is deprecated, use the
  `System.Action<Dictionary<string, string>>` delegate instead to receive
  property updates.

- The `threadHook` member of `InitializationData` is now deprecated. Instead,
  set `threadStart` and `threadStop`.

- The `Ice.ClassResolver` delegate has been replaced with the
  `System.Func<string, Type>` delegate. The `Ice.CompactIdResolver` delegate
  has been replaced with the `System.Func<int, string>` delegate. The
  `Ice.Dispatcher` delegate has been replaced with the
  `System.Action<System.Action, Ice.Connection>` delegate.

- Added new interface/class metadata `cs:tie`. Use this metadata to generate a
  tie class for a given interface or class.

- `cs:` and `clr:` are now interchangeable in metadata directives.

- Add support to preload referenced assemblies. The property
  `Ice.PreloadAssemblies` controls this behavior. If set to a value greater than
  0 the Ice run-time will try to load all the assemblies referenced by the
  process during communicator initialization, otherwise the referenced
  assemblies will be initialized when the Ice run-time needs to lookup a C#
  class. The default value is 0.

- Update C# proxy implementation to implement `ISerializable`.

## Java Changes

- Added a new Java mapping that takes advantage of Java 8 language features. The
  new mapping is significantly different than prior releases in many ways,
  including the package name (com.zeroc) as well as APIs such as AMI, AMD, out
  parameters and optional values. The prior mapping, now known as Java Compat,
  is still supported so that existing applications can be migrated to Ice 3.7
  without much change.

- The Ice Communicator interface now implements `java.lang.AutoCloseable`.
  This enables the code to initialize the communicator within a
  `try-with-resources` statement. The communicator will be destroyed
   automatically at the end of this statement.

- Fixed a bug where unmarshaling Ice objects was very slow when using
  compact type IDs.

- (Java) Added the proxy method `ice_executor`, which returns an instance of
  `java.util.concurrent.Executor` that you can pass to `CompletableFuture`
  methods such as `whenCompleteAsync` in order to force an action to be
  executed by an Ice thread pool thread.

- (Java Compat) Added new interface/class metadata `java:tie`. Use this metadata
  to generate a tie class for a given interface or class.

- Protocol compression now uses Bzip2 implementation from Apache Commons Compress,
  previous versions use Bizp2 implementation from Apache Ant.

## JavaScript Changes

- Improved the `Ice.Long` class to allow creating `Ice.Long` instance from
  JavaScript `Numbers`.

- Updated the `Ice.Promise` class. It now extends the standard JavaScript
  `Promise` class.

- The `Ice.Class` helper function used to create classes has been removed. The
  Ice run time and the generated code now use the JavaScript `class` keyword to
  define the classes.

- `Ice.HashMap` usage is now limited to dictionaries with mutable keys, for all
  other cases the standard JavaScript `Map` type is used.

- `Ice.HashMap` API has been aligned with the API of JavaScript `Map` type.

- Added support to map Slice modules to JavaScript native modules this requires
  using the global metadata `[["js:es6-module"]]`.

- The `["amd"]` metadata is now ignored in JavaScript. An operation can now be
  be dispatched asynchronously by just returning a JavaScript Promise object.

- `sequence<byte>` is now always mapped to the `Uint8Array` JavaScript type. It
  used to be mapped to the `Buffer` type for NodeJS and to `Uint8Array` for
  browsers.

- The helper method `Ice.Buffer.createNative` has been removed and replaced by
  the use of `Uint8Array`.

## Objective-C Changes

- Added clear selector to `ICESlicedData` to allow clearing the slices
  associated with the slice data. Calling `clear` can be useful if the sliced
  data contains cycles. You should call this method if your application receives
  sliced values which might contain cycles.

- The UDP and WS transports are no longer enabled by default with static builds
  of the IceObjC library. You need to register them explicitly with the
  `ICEregisterIceUDP` or `ICEregisterIceWS` function to use these transports
   with your statically linked application.

  NOTE: this affects iOS applications which are linked statically with Ice
  libraries.

- Fixed a bug where optional object dictionary parameters would
  trigger an assert on marshaling.

- The `--dll-export` option of `slice2objc` is now deprecated, and replaced by
  the global Slice metadata `objc:dll-export:SYMBOL`.

- Added `objc:scoped` metadata for enums. The generated Objective-C enumerators
  for a "scoped enum" are prefixed with the enumeration's name. For example:
  ```
  // Slice
  module M
  {
     ["objc:scoped"] enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Pear }
  }

  ```
  corresponds to:
  ```
  // Objective-C
  typedef enum : ICEInt
  {
      MFruitApple,
      MFruitPear,
      MFruitOrange
  } MFruit;
  ```

## PHP Changes

- Ice for PHP now uses namespace by default.

- Added support for PHP 7.0 and PHP 7.1.

- The symbol used to indicate an unset optional value for the PHP namespace
  mapping is `Ice\None`. The symbol for the flattened mapping remains
 `Ice_Unset`,  but since `unset` is a PHP keyword, we could not use `Ice\Unset`.

## Python Changes

- Added a new AMI mapping that returns `Ice.Future`. The Future class provides
  an API that is compatible with `concurrent.futures.Future`, with some
  additional Ice-specific methods. Programs can use the new mapping by adding the
  suffix `Async` to operation names, such as `sayHelloAsync`. The existing
  `begin_/end_` mapping is still supported.

- Changed the AMD mapping. AMD servant methods must no longer append the `_async`
  suffix to their names. Additionally, an AMD callback is no longer passed to a
  servant method.
  Now a servant method always uses the mapped name, and it can either return the
  results (for a synchronous implementation) or return an `Ice.Future` (for an
  asynchronous implementation).

  With Python 3, a servant method can also be implemented as a coroutine. Ice
  will start the coroutine, and coroutines can `await` on `Ice.Future` objects.
  Note that because Ice is multithreaded, users who also want to use the asyncio
  package must make sure it's done in a thread-safe manner. To assist with this,
  the `Ice.wrap_future` function accepts an `Ice.Future` and returns an
  `asyncio.Future`.

- Revised the Ice for Python packaging layout. Using the new Slice metadata
  directive `python:pkgdir`, all generated files are now placed in their
  respective package directories.

- The Ice Communicator now implements the context manager protocol. This enables
  the code to initialize the communicator within a `with` statement.
  The communicator is destroyed automatically at the end of the `with` statement.

- Added support for the Dispatcher facility. The `dispatcher` member of
  `InitializationData` can be set to a callable that Ice invokes when it
  needs to dispatch a servant invocation or an AMI callback. This facility
  is useful for example in UI applications where it's convenient to
  schedule Ice activity for execution on the main UI thread.

- The `threadHook` member of `InitializationData` is now deprecated. We have
  added `threadStart` and `threadStop` members for consistency with the C++11
  and Java mappings. A program should set these members to a callable, such as
  a lambda function.

- The `batchRequestInterceptor` member of `InitializationData` can now be set
  to a callable. For backward compatibility, a program can also continue to
  supply an instance of the deprecated class `Ice.BatchRequestInterceptor`.

- Renamed optional invocation context parameter to `context` for consistency
  with other language mappings (was `_ctx` in previous versions).

- Fixed a bug where `Ice.Application` Ctrl-C handler was installed even if
  `Ice.Application.NoSignalHandling` was set.

## Ruby Changes

- Ice for Ruby is no longer supported on Windows.

- Fix `Application` Ctrl-C handling to be compatible with Ruby 2.x signal
   handler restrictions.

- Fixed a bug that prevented the data members of `IceSSL::ConnectionInfo` from
  being defined correctly.
